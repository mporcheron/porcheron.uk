    title: A summary of Martin Porcheron's videos and talks, including courses taught in academia

Below is a selection of videos and recorded talks I have given, including my teaching while I worked in academia. While I have given many more talks than below, unfortunately many have not been made public (e.g., due to rights) or were not even recorded in the first place.

I am open to giving guest lectures in academia, focusing on the design and use of conversational technologies, and the application of user experience and human computer interaction in industry, from a practitioner's perspective. Please [contact me](/contact/) me for more information.

### Pulling Back the Curtain on the Wizards of Oz

I presented work on a reflective use of the Wizard of Oz methodology, presented at [ACM CSCW 2020](https://cscw.acm.org/2020/) conference. The paper adopted an auto-ethnographic ethnomethodological analysis to describe the intricacies in deploying 'voice-controlled vacuums' through the Wizard of Oz approach.

### Voice Interfaces in Everyday Life

I presented work on the use of voice technologies in the home, presented at the [ACM CHI 2018](https://chi2018.acm.org/) conference. The paper focuses on a study using a novel data collection device to understand how families and multi-occupancy homes made use of the Amazon Alexa smartspeaker in their daily lives. The publication received a Best Paper award. Download the paper and citation information [from my publications list](/pubs/#porcheron2018voice).

## Teaching in Academia

While as a Senior Lecturer at [Swansea University](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/compsci/ "Computer Science at Swansea University"), I co-ordinated and lectured on the module *CSC371 Advanced Object-Oriented Programming* (C and C++ for third-year Computer Science students) in the 2020/21 and 2021/22 academic years. I also taught on the *CS-210 Concurrency* module in the 2021/22 academic year, along with [Dr Alma Rahat](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/staff/a.a.m.rahat/ "Alma Rahat on the Swansea University website").

While a Research Fellow at the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/computerscience/index.aspx "Computer Science at the University of Nottingham"), I assisted with the teaching of a number of modules including ethnography and design, binary arithmetic and logic, *Java* (advanced), *C/C++* (advanced), *Python* (introductory), and *Android* (advanced).
