# Teaching

At [Swansea University](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/compsci/ "Computer Science at Swansea University") I co-ordinated and lectured on the module *CSC371 Advanced Object-Oriented Programming* (C and C++ for third-year Computer Science students) in the 2020/21 and 2021/22 academic years. I also taught on the *CS-210 Concurrency* module in the 2021/22 academic year, along with [Dr Alma Rahat](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/staff/a.a.m.rahat/ "Alma Rahat on the Swansea University website").

Prior to this while at the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/computerscience/index.aspx "Computer Science at the University of Nottingham"), I assisted with the teaching of a number of modules including ethnography and design, binary arithmetic and logic, *Java* (advanced), *C/C++* (advanced), *Python* (introductory), and *Android* (advanced).

## Student projects

I am open to supervising fourth year students (UG/PGT) in the 2021/22 academic year. Students should be broadly interested in [human-computer interaction](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/human-computer-interaction "Read about HCI on by the Interaction Design Foundation") and/or [user experience design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design "Read about User Experience Design on Wikipedia"). A number of project ideas include:

* Literature review of practices for designing voice/"conversational" user interfacesâ€”this review could focus on specific issues such as accessibility or be broader in emphasis
* User study and evaluation of a voice or chatbot-based 'interactive AI' (e.g. Amazon Echo Skills, Google Home, virtual humans, robotics etc) in specific setting or for a specific task such as shopping, meeting scheduling, or supporting coordination between remote workers etc.
* User study to compare different interfaces (e.g. you could simulate different voice or chat interfaces using the "Wizard of Oz" method) to compare the experience with different approaches or qualities (e.g. comparing different styles of voice feedback etc).

These are not exclusive ideas, but rather areas that could be seen fit into your own specific idea. I am open to combinations  with other disciplines. For example, if you have an ML topic and are interested in the user experience aspect of how users interact with the algorithm, then this is may be a viable project for me to supervise.

Where possible, I encourage students to think about how their work might translate into an academic publication.

More details are available through the [CS Project Manager website](https://csprojectmanager.swan.ac.uk/ "Swansea University CS Project Manager website").

If you are interested in a undertaking your project with me and would like to chat, please [contact me](/contact "My contact details").
