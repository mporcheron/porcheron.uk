## Content Delivery Networks

This website uses Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to ensure you can access the website and its resources quickly.

**Google Fonts API** is used to provide custom font support. Privacy information about Google Fonts API is available from [this Google FAQ](https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq2#what_does_using_the_google_fonts_api_mean_for_the_privacy_of_my_users "Privacy information about Google Fonts"):

> No cookies are sent by website visitors to the Google Fonts API. Requests to the Google Fonts API are made to resource-specific domains, such as fonts.googleapis.com or fonts.gstatic.com. This means your font requests are separate from and don't contain any credentials you send to google.com while using other Google services that are authenticated, such as Gmail. … Google Fonts logs records of the CSS and the font file requests, and access to this data is kept secure. Aggregate usage numbers track how popular font families are and are published on our analytics page.
