## Google Fonts API

**Google Fonts API** is used to provide custom font support. Privacy information about Google Fonts API is available from [this Google FAQ](https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq2#what_does_using_the_google_fonts_api_mean_for_the_privacy_of_my_users "Privacy information about Google Fonts"):

> The Google Fonts API is designed to limit the collection, storage, and use of end-user data to only what is needed to serve fonts efficiently. The use of the Google Fonts API is unauthenticated and the Google Fonts API does not set or log cookies. Requests to the Google Fonts API are made to resource-specific domains, such as fonts.googleapis.com or fonts.gstatic.com. Font requests are separate from and don't contain any credentials sent to google.com while using other Google services that are authenticated, such as Gmail.
>
> The Google Fonts API logs the details of the HTTP request, which includes the timestamp, requested URL, and all HTTP headers (including referrer and user agent string) provided in connection with the use of our CSS API.
> 
> IP addresses are not logged.
>
> Access to logged data is kept secure. Aggregate usage stats are used to measure the popularity of font families and are published on the Google Fonts [analytics page](https://fonts.google.com/analytics "Statistics about Google Fonts").
> 
To learn more about the information Google collects and how it is used and secured, see Google's [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy "Google's Privacy Policy").

## YouTube

This website occasionally includes videos that are hosted on the [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/ "YouTube") service. YouTube is owned by [Google](https://www.google.com/ "Google").

By default, videos are not embedded on webpages, but instead a placeholder is displayed. Clicking on this placeholder (which says '_Load YouTube video_') will embed the video in the webpage using a 'privacy-enhanced mode'. YouTube states this embedded video will not [influence your user experience](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en-GB#zippy=%2Cturn-on-privacy-enhanced-mode "Google FAQ on Privacy-Enhanced Mode"):

> The privacy-enhanced mode of the YouTube embedded player prevents the use of views of embedded YouTube content from influencing the viewer's browsing experience on YouTube. This means that the view of a video shown in the privacy-enhanced mode of the embedded player will not be used to personalise the YouTube browsing experience, either within your privacy-enhanced mode embedded player or in the viewer's subsequent YouTube viewing experience. 
>
> If ads are served on a video shown in the privacy-enhanced mode of the embedded player, those ads will likewise be non-personalised. In addition, the view of a video shown in the privacy-enhanced mode of the embedded player will not be used to personalise advertising shown to the viewer outside of your site or app.

Please note however, that there are privacy implications of loading embedded contentâ€”this is like loading a webpage normally in your browser and carries all the same risks. As such, interaction with any embedded video is subject to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB "YouTube's privacy guidelines"). Therefore, although your use of the embedded video may not influence your user experience on YouTube, Google may sitll collect personally identifiable information.
