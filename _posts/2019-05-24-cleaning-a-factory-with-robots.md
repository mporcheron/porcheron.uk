# Cleaning a factory with robots

I am currently involved with the RoboClean project at the University of Nottingham. This project is investigating the potential of human-robot collaboration, integrated with IoT smart sensors for cleaning and allergen detection on factory floors. The outcomes of this project will include the design, implementation, and evaluation of an interactive system that could clean factory floors alongside human workers, while performing on-line detection of allergens.

## Project background 

In food and drink manufacturing, a significant amount of employee time is dedicated to cleaning, which bears a major impact on employee productivity and manufacturing efficiency. The process of cleaning factory equipment typically unfolds as part of a process known as Clean-in-Place and is beginning to take advantage of novel technologies such as in-line sensors, the IoT, and machine learning. However, the work of cleaning the factory floor is still primarily completed by human workers following strict industry standards specified by the [British Retail Consortium (BRC)](http://www.nifcc.co.uk/filestore/documents/publications/BRC_Global_Standard_for_Food_Safety_Issue_7_UK_Free_PDF2.pdf "Read the 'Global Standard Food Safety - Issue 7' by the British Retail Consortium").

This project seeks to understand and address the industry need for cleaning support technologies and is developing systems for deploying robots to assist in the cleaning of factories. Furthermore, the robots will be designed to detect and report the unwanted presence of allergens to prevent food safety events using smart sensor data analytics (e.g. for [wheat gluten protein](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/aoac/jaoac/2017/00000100/00000005/art00044 "An article, 'Near-Infrared Spectrum Detection of Wheat Gluten Protein Content Based on a Combined Filtering Method', in the Journal of AOAC International"), [peanuts in cereals](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1537511016301313 "An article, 'Discrimination of peanuts from bulk cereals and nuts by near infrared reflectance spectroscopy', in the Journal of Biosystems Engineering"), and [peanuts in wheat flour](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1255/jnirs.1141 "An article, 'Detection and quantification of peanut traces in wheat flour by near infrared hyperspectral imaging spectroscopy using principal-component analysis', in the Journal of Near Infrared Spectroscopy")). Additionally, the project aims to tackle one of the biggest challenges facing manufacturers, which is the cross contamination of allergens within the manufacturing environment. Regular cleaning is a critical step to preventing this, but this challenge is exacerbated as manufacturers strive to provide more variety and alternative formulations (e.g. gluten free) and are required to [verify the effectiveness of cleaning procedures for removing allergens from equipment as per the BRC industry standards](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/aoac/jaoac/2018/00000101/00000001/art00008?crawler=true&mimetype=application/pdf "An article, 'Managing food allergens in the UK retail supply chain', in the Journal of AOAC International"). The Food Standards Agency states that the number of food and safety events relating to all allergens has roughly doubled between [2014/15](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/annual-report-of-food-incidents-201617 "'The Annual Report of Food Incidents 2016/17', which includes data for 2014/15") and [2017/18](https://data.food.gov.uk/catalog/datasets/f0db1a56-1088-4199-9e42-ddcde2546237 "The Open Data set, 'Summary of Incident Notifications received by the Food Standards Agency', from which the data was compiled") highlighting the pressing need to integrate smart sensors into the manufacturing and cleaning processes.

Furthermore, a key focus for the project is to develop an understanding of human-robot collaboration in complex environments such as factories (building upon [studies of robots in-the-wild](https://riglab.infosci.cornell.edu/assets/papers/wild.pdf "Read 'Robots in the Wild: A Time for More Robust Theoriesof Human-Robot Interaction', in the ACM Transactions on Human-Robot Interaction")), and how to coordinate multiple cleaning robots as co-bot teams (i.e. multi-agent collaboration). These foci will help to deliver novel solutions for monitoring and delivering cleaning to the required standards in an efficient and safe manner, alongside–and with– human workers on a factory floor. The outcomes of this project will include the design, implementation, and evaluation of an interactive connected system enabling novel human-robot collaboration and sensor data collection in a factory by engaging with partners in industry (British Pepper and Spice) and the third sector (the Food and Drink Forum).
