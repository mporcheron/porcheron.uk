<!--I am a Senior User Experience Researcher at [Bold Insight UK](https://boldinsight.co.uk "Bold Insight UK"). Previously, I have been a Senior Lecturer in the [Swansea University Computational Foundry](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/science/computationalfoundry/ "The Swansea University Computational Foundry website") and a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Mixed Reality Lab](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/mrl "The Mixed Reality Laboratory at the University of Nottingham"] at the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/computerscience/index.aspx "Computer Science at the University of Nottingham"). 

I am a founding member of the [ACM Conversational User Interfaces (CUI) Steering Committee](https://www.conversationaluserinterfaces.org/ "The Conversational User Interfaces community website") and am serving as conference General Chair for [CUI 2023](https://ttps://www.conversationaluserinterfaces.org/2023/ "The Fifth Conference on Conversational User Interfaces"). I have been an Associate Chair for the [ACM CSCW conference](https://cscw.acm.org/ "The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing website") and [ACM CHI conference](https://chi.acm.org/ "The ACM Conference on Computer Human Interaction website") conferences in the past, as well as General Chair of the [Halfway to the Future symposium](https://www.halfwaytothefuture.org "Halfway to the Future symposium website").

My research focuses on the user experience of interactive AI systems—from voice interfaces through to robot interfaces, drawing upon a mixture of qualitative and quantitative research methods. In my PhD, I studied public places like cafés and pubs to understand how we use devices like smartphones while we are socialising.

On this website I maintain a fairly up-to-date list of [my publications](/pubs "My publications list") and also periodically [blog about my research](/blog "My personal research blog") too.-->

In January 2023, I will be joining [Bold Insight UK](https://boldinsight.co.uk "Bold Insight UK") as a Senior UX Researcher.

I am a Senior Lecturer in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/compsci/ "The Swansea University Department of Computer Science website"), based in the [Swansea University Computational Foundry](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/science/computationalfoundry/ "The Swansea University Computational Foundry website"). My research is in the areas of [human-computer interaction](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/human-computer-interaction "Read about HCI on the Interaction Design Foundation") and [computer-supported cooperative work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-supported_cooperative_work "Read about CSCW on Wikipedia").

My recent work focuses on the user experience of interactive AI systems—from voice interfaces through to robot interfaces. In my PhD, I also studied public places like cafés and pubs, to understand how we use devices like smartphones while we are socialising.

On this website I maintain a fairly up-to-date list of my [current and past research projects](/research "Research projects I am involved in"). You can also browse and download [my publications](/pubs "My publications list"). Alternatively, [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=xqQs-LEAAAAJ "My Google Scholar profile") has a relatively accurate personal bibliography. I periodically [blog about my research](/blog "My personal research blog") here too.

I am a member of the [Conversational User Interfaces (CUI) Steering Committee](https://www.conversationaluserinterfaces.org/ "The Conversational User Interfaces community website"), and actively maintain the community's website. I have served as *Full Papers Co-Chair* for [CUI 2019](ttps://www.conversationaluserinterfaces.org/2021/ "The Second Conference on Conversational User Interfaces"), *Program Co-Chair* for [2020](ttps://www.conversationaluserinterfaces.org/2021/ "The Second Conference on Conversational User Interfaces"), and *Programme Co-Chair* and *Featured Talks Co-Chair* for [2021](https://ttps://www.conversationaluserinterfaces.org/2022/ "The Third Conference on Conversational User Interfaces"). I have been an Associate Chair for the [ACM CSCW conference](https://cscw.acm.org/ "The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing website") for a number of years and am an Associate Chair for the [ACM CHI 2022 conference](https://chi2022.acm.org/ "The ACM Conference on Computer Human Interaction website").

I was previously involved in the organisation of the [Halfway to the Future symposium](https://www.halfwaytothefuture.org "Halfway to the Future symposium website") as a General Chair (with Treasurer, Registration, and Communications responsibilities).
