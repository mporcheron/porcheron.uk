I am a Senior User Experience Researcher at [Bold Insight](https://boldinsight.com/ "Bold Insight"). Previously, I have been a Senior Lecturer in the [Swansea University Computational Foundry](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/science/computationalfoundry/ "The Swansea University Computational Foundry website") and a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Mixed Reality Lab](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/mrl "The Mixed Reality Laboratory at the University of Nottingham"] at the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/computerscience/index.aspx "Computer Science at the University of Nottingham").

[My research](/research/) focuses on the user experience of interactive AI systems—from voice interfaces through to medical devices, drawing upon a mixture of qualitative and quantitative research methods. In [my PhD](/research/#phd), which I undertook at the University of Nottingham, I studied public places like cafés and pubs to understand how people use devices like smartphones while they are socialising.

I co-founded the [ACM Conversational User Interfaces (CUI) conference](https://cui.acm.org/sc/ "The Conversational User Interfaces community website"), which focuses on the design and user experience of conversational technologies, and the [Halfway to the Future (HttF) symposium](https://www.halfwaytothefuture.net/ "Halfway to the Future symposium website"), a quinquennial symposium on the state of design and research in human-computer interaction. I was a General Chair for [ACM CUI 2023](https://cui.acm.org/2023/ "The Fifth Conference on Conversational User Interfaces") and [HttF 2019](https://www.halfwaytothefuture.net/2019/), and have served as an Associate Chair for past [ACM CSCW conferences](https://cscw.acm.org/ "The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing website") and [ACM CHI conferences](https://chi.acm.org/ "The ACM Conference on Computer Human Interaction website") in the past.
