I'm Martin, a Senior User Experience (UX) Researcher at [Bold Insight](https://boldinsight.com/ "Bold Insight"), where I lead and execute UX and human factors research projects. My work is often composed of national and international teams and spans from early discovery to iterative usability testing, with a strong focus on messaging, payments, interactive AIs, and medical devices. 

I specialise in turning complex user behaviours into clear, actionable insights that guide product strategy, marketing, and design decisions. With a [PhD in Human-Computer Interaction](/phd/) and over a decade of experience spanning industry and academia, I bring a blend of rigour and real-world impact to every project. This website documents my [publication history](/pubs/) and the [talks, workshops and conferences](/talks/) that I have organised.

I remain committed to giving back to and helping define the communities from which I have learned so much. I co-founded [ACM Conversational User Interfaces (CUI)](https://cui.acm.org/community/ "The Conversational User Interfaces community website"), an international conference series on the design and user experience of conversational technologies, and [Halfway to the Future (HttF)](https://www.halfwaytothefuture.net/ "Halfway to the Future symposium website"), a quinquennial symposium on the state of design and research in human-computer interaction. I was a General Chair for [ACM CUI 2023](https://cui.acm.org/2023/ "The Fifth Conference on Conversational User Interfaces") and [HttF 2019](https://www.halfwaytothefuture.net/2019/), and have served as an Associate Chair for past [ACM CSCW](https://cscw.acm.org/ "The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing website") and [ACM CHI](https://chi.acm.org/ "The ACM Conference on Computer Human Interaction website") conferences.
