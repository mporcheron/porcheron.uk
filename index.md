# About me

{% include figure_image.html src="martinporcheron.jpg" alt="A photograph of Martin Porcheron" title="Martin Porcheron" autosize="false" %}

I am a Senior User Experience Researcher at [Bold Insight UK](https://boldinsight.co.uk "Bold Insight UK"). Previously, I have been a Senior Lecturer in the [Swansea University Computational Foundry](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/science/computationalfoundry/ "The Swansea University Computational Foundry website") and a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Mixed Reality Lab](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/mrl "The Mixed Reality Laboratory at the University of Nottingham"] at the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/computerscience/index.aspx "Computer Science at the University of Nottingham").

I am a founding member of the [ACM Conversational User Interfaces (CUI) Steering Committee](https://cui.acm.org/sc/ "The Conversational User Interfaces community website") and am serving as conference General Chair for [CUI 2023](https://cui.acm.org/2023/ "The Fifth Conference on Conversational User Interfaces"). I have been an Associate Chair for the [ACM CSCW conference](https://cscw.acm.org/ "The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing website") and [ACM CHI conference](https://chi.acm.org/ "The ACM Conference on Computer Human Interaction website") conferences in the past, as well as General Chair of the [Halfway to the Future symposium](https://www.halfwaytothefuture.org "Halfway to the Future symposium website").

My research focuses on the user experience of interactive AI systems—from voice interfaces through to robot interfaces, drawing upon a mixture of qualitative and quantitative research methods. In my PhD, I studied public places like cafés and pubs to understand how we use devices like smartphones while we are socialising.

On this website I maintain a fairly up-to-date list of [my publications](/pubs "My publications list").
